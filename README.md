The website is created to display two different themes (Dark & Light) as is for use by the users descretion

## Testing

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers, as well as tested on Samsung S20FE and Samsung Galaxy 8 and iPhone 10 model handheld devices

Steps to test:

1. Open the browser and navigate to [JavaScript Quiz Game Multiple Choice](https://github.com/trevthedev777/javascriptQuizGameMultipleChoice)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Choose each responsive screen device using shortcut Cntrl + shift + m
6. Click and drag the responsive window to the maximum width

Expected:

The game to adapt per size, and stack elements on the smallest screen sizes.

Actual:

The website behaved as expected.

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used as a guide to making sure colour contrasts were fine and that there were no errors with any HTML attributes

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

-   All link tags have the correct path to stylesheets and script
-   Aria labels were used for any links
-   Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
-   Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end-user
-   All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
-   All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
-   The HTML page lang attribute has been set
-   Aria properties have been implemented correctly
-   WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and some accessibility issues were identified.

Issue #1: Styles not loading into the website.

Fix: Correct paths were given to link the documents together for all styles and JS technologies to work smoothly.

Issue #2: Script not loading into the website.

Fix: Correct paths were given to link the documents together for all styles and JS technologies to work smoothly.

Issue #3: 404.html not loading into the correct page

Fix: renamed the document to the correct name.

Issue #4: Total correct score not calculating at the end of the game

Fix: Added a new js file saving the local session score

Issue #5: Hover effect not working on buttons

Fix: renamed elements to corresponding class names

Issue #6: Progress Bar not incrementing per question

**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed on 404.html, index.html, and end.html to ensure that the game was directed to the home screen

Links on all pages are navigated to the correct pages as expected.

**Game Play**

-   User starts the game and answers the question
-   Question has timeout function to automatically progress the game so the user does not have to select the next question manually
-   Progress bar increases per question
-   Score increments on every correct answer

The timeout function works correctly

**Game Board**

-   Correct Answer displays green background upon selection
-   Incorrect Answer displays red background upon selection and does not show the right answer so user can play again

All displays and transitions displayed correctly

**End of Game**

-   Navigation to start of quiz and home page

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using Gitpod and pushed to Github to the remote repository ‘Portfolio-Project-2-Poker-Fun’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

`git add .` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

`git commit -m “commit message”` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on GitHub.

### Deployment to Github Pages

-   The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    -   In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    -   From the menu on the left select 'Pages'
    -   From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
    -   Click 'Save'
    -   A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully.

The live link can be found here - https://github.com/trevthedev777/javascriptQuizGameMultipleChoice

### Clone the Repository Code Locally

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

-   Click on the code drop-down button
-   Click on HTTPS
-   Copy the repository link to the clipboard
-   Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
-   Type git clone copied-git-URL into the IDE terminal
